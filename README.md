# ðŸ’¬ Updated PDF Chatbot
A Streamlit application that allows users to upload PDF documents and engage in a conversational AI chat through a chat interface. Built using Streamlit, LangChain, ChromaDB, and local LLM models like Llama2 with Ollama.


# ðŸš€ Demo

1. **Upload PDFs**: Upload one or multiple PDF files.
2. **Ask Questions**: Enter your question about the PDF content.
3. **Get Responses**: The chatbot will provide relevant answers based on the document content.
4. **Demo Link**: https://github.com/pruthi-saksham/Updated-PDF-Chatbot/blob/main/app3.mp4
  - Visit the link
  - Click on `View raw`
  - The video will be downloaded to your local system.


# Features

- **PDF Uploading:** 
  - Supports multiple PDF uploads at once.
  - Each PDF is processed to extract its content for interaction.

- **Managing Sessions:**
    - *Session ID*: Each conversation is associated with a Session ID (default: `default_session`).
    - *Start a New Chat*: To reset the chat history or begin a new conversation, enter a new Session ID in the input field. Each session maintains its own chat history, allowing you to manage multiple conversations simultaneously.

- **Vector Store:** 
  - Uses ChromaDB to store vector embeddings of PDF text.
  - Efficient retrieval of relevant document sections for accurate responses.

- **Conversational History:**
  - Maintains chat history to ensure context-aware responses.
  - Past queries and answers are stored and used for reformulation of current queries.

- **LLM Integration:** 
  - Utilizes a local `llama2` model via Ollama for text generation.
  - Avoids the need for external API keys, offering a fully local solution.

- **Interactive Chat Interface:** 
  - Built using Streamlit for real-time interaction.
  - Users can ask questions directly about the uploaded PDFs and receive answers immediately.


## Run Locally

Ensure the following dependencies are installed and configured:

- **Python Version:** 3.12
- **Streamlit:** Latest version
- **Ollama Model:** Download and set up `llama2` model locally by running this command in yoy command prompt `ollama run llama2`.


- **Clone the project repository to your local machine**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pruthi-saksham/Updated-PDF-Chatbot
```

- **Go to the project directory**:
```bash
cd Updated-PDF-Chatbot
```

- **Install dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- **Run the Main Streamlit App `app3.py`**:  
The project includes three code files: `app.py`, `app2.py`, and `app3.py`. The first two were initial versions, but due to some issues, the main file is `app3.py`, which offers better functionality and an improved interface, But feel free to explore the other two files. Run the following command to start the app:

```bash
streamlit run app3.py
```


# Tech Stack

1. **Streamlit**:
- Provides the interactive web interface for uploading PDFs and interacting with the chatbot.
- Easily deployable and well-suited for building quick prototypes and web apps.

2. **LangChain**:
- An open-source framework that simplifies the integration of language models with other components such as document retrievers and conversational agents.
- LangChainâ€™s retrieval system is used to combine chat history with document retrieval, ensuring accurate, context-aware responses.
- Handles the process of chaining together models, retrieval systems, and prompts into a unified workflow for query handling.

3. **ChromaDB**:
- A vector database that allows efficient storage and retrieval of vectorized document embeddings.
- It helps index document chunks and enables the system to quickly retrieve relevant information based on user queries.

4. **HuggingFace Embeddings**:
- Sentence-transformers/paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2 is used to generate embeddings from the text in the uploaded PDFs.
- These embeddings are then stored in ChromaDB for fast and relevant document retrieval during interactions.

5. **PyPDFLoader**:
- A Python tool for loading PDF files and extracting their textual content.
- It allows text extraction from each page of the uploaded PDFs, making it possible to parse large documents for efficient searching and interaction.

6. **ChatOllama (Local LLM)**:
- The ChatOllama library integrates with the Llama2 model, a large language model (LLM) that runs locally.
- Ensures all processing stays within the local environment, avoiding the need for external API calls.
- It is designed for efficient and scalable local AI model hosting, ensuring that the chatbot can generate meaningful responses without relying on cloud services.

7. **LangChain RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**:
- Combines the power of document retrieval and language models to enhance response quality.
- The integration of retrieval chains and history-aware retrievers makes the model contextually aware of past interactions, improving accuracy and continuity in conversation.
